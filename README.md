#  Store Management System 

This is a simple object-oriented Python project that simulates a store with products.  
It demonstrates **OOP concepts** such as **encapsulation** and **composition**:

- `Product` class → represents individual products.
- `Store` class → manages a collection of products.
- `main.py` → provides an interactive CLI menu to interact with the store.
